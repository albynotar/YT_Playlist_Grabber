# YT_Playlist_Grabber

A simple website to get playlist and video information from a YT playlist as a .json.

*Update: Python anywhere removed youtube.com from the supported websites for their free tier accounts*
*thus the demo website does not work properly anymore, returning an error even when a query is valid*
